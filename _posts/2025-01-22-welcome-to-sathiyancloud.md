# Welcome to SathiyanCloud

If you're reading this, you've taken the first step. That takes courage.

Cloud and DevOps can feel overwhelming when you're starting out. There are so many tools, so many opinions, and so many paths that claim to be "the right one."

Here's what I believe: **there is no single right path — but there are fundamentals that matter regardless of which direction you choose.**

## What We'll Cover

In the coming weeks and months, you'll find posts on:

- **Linux essentials** — the operating system that runs most of the cloud
- **Networking basics** — understanding how data moves
- **Containers and Docker** — packaging applications the modern way
- **Kubernetes fundamentals** — orchestrating containers at scale
- **Cloud platforms** — AWS, Azure, GCP and when to use what
- **CI/CD pipelines** — automating your deployments
- **Career guidance** — resumes, interviews, and what hiring managers look for

## A Note on Pace

This isn't a bootcamp. There's no timer counting down.

Take your time with each concept. Practice the labs. Ask questions when you're stuck. The goal isn't to rush through content — it's to build understanding that stays with you.

## What's Next

Start with the basics. If you're not comfortable with the Linux command line yet, that's where we'll begin.

And remember: every expert you admire was once exactly where you are now.
