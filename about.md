# About SathiyanCloud

SathiyanCloud is a small learning initiative focused on helping students understand **Cloud and DevOps fundamentals** in a simple, practical way.

I’m **Sathiyan**, a Cloud & DevOps engineer by profession.  
I come from a non-CS background and moved into IT through **self-learning, hands-on practice, and real problem solving**. Along the way, **guidance from mentors helped me choose the right learning path**.

Like many students, I started with confusion and too many options. SathiyanCloud was created to **bridge the gap between college education and real-world IT skills**, especially for students from **colleges with limited industry exposure**.

## What SathiyanCloud Is About

This initiative is not about shortcuts or hype.  
The focus is on:

- Strong fundamentals  
- Understanding different IT roles  
- Hands-on learning  
- Building confidence step by step  

## Learning Approach

Sessions can be conducted in **Tamil or English**, based on student comfort.

I’m still learning myself — because in IT, learning never really stops.  
My role here is to **simplify concepts, guide learning, and share practical experience**.
